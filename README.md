## Introduction
<a name="intro"></a>

This is my first attempt at PWA (Progressive Web App) which allows users to access basic functionality of an application OFFLINE ! Isn't that cool ? Well this is a very simple app that keeps a track of a user's expenses and if a user has made some changes while offline, it saves it in indexDB(browser's DB) and when the user comes back online will update it on the server.


## User Story
<a name="userStory"></a>

As an avid traveller I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling or when i do not have internet.


## Installation
<a name="installation"></a>

* express
